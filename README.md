**Throttler** is a Go library for managing task execution with features like:  
- **Rate Limiting** to handle API or database constraints.  
- **Task Scheduling** with retries, backoff, and priority management.  
- **Circuit Breaking** to avoid cascading failures.  

---

## Features  
- Flexible APIs for defining tasks: Use closures or the `Executable` interface.  
- Automatic retry with backoff for failed tasks.  
- Rate limit enforcement to handle throughput-heavy workloads.  
- Priority-based task execution with first-in-first-out (FIFO) fallback.  
- Built-in metrics collection for monitoring queue size and execution.

## Installation  
```bash
go get github.com/gopal96685/throttler
